        <p class="para">Earth is our home planet, the third from the Sun. It is the only known planet to support life, with air, water, and land sustaining millions of species. About 71% of Earth is covered in oceans, while the rest consists of continents, mountains, forests, and deserts. It has a protective atmosphere that regulates temperature and shields us from harmful space radiation. Earth rotates on its axis, causing day and night, and orbits the Sun, creating seasons. Human activities impact Earth's environment, leading to climate change. Protecting Earthâ€™s natural resources is essential for future generations to thrive on this beautiful planet.</p>
